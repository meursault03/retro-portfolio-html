<p>You may wonder how can someone enjoy comedy those days, and I feel like i may have the answer haha ;)</p>
<p>I did some really funny jokes in my last show in Lybia, yeah, that's what you've just read LYBIA. I'm a well-travelled person, and I never lie haha ;)</p>
<h4>SO HERE'S A LIST OF MY TOP 3 JOKES I DID IN MY SHOW</h4>
<ol>
<li>I'm scared I may never find a girlfriend, maybe because I'm ugly haha ;)</li>
<li>Back in my days, everyone used to have fun, I think comedy is dead. I lived the comedy in my youth, I used to be the punchline when Stacey told her boyfriend I was a creep haha :)</li>
<li>I'm thinking about getting arrested, I don't even have money to eat. My landlord my evict me soon, getting arrested is the only way I have to survive haha:)</li>
</ol>
<H4>YOU MAY ASK YOURSELF WHAT WAS THE OUTCOME OF THE SHOW?</H4>
<p>Well, I tried to bring comedy to Lebanon, or Lybia, I'm not sure what was the country haha :)<br>
They didn't really understand me because they didn't speak English hahahahahaahaha :)</p>
